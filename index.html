          Subhas Chandra Bose was a prominent Indian freedom fighter who played
          a key role in India's struggle for <em> Independence </em> against
          British rule. Born on <em> 23 January 1897 </em>, in Cuttack, Orissa,
          Bose was the ninth child of a wealthy lawyer.

          Bose studied at the University of Calcutta and later went to England
          to pursue higher studies. However, he was expelled from the University
          of Calcutta for participating in a student protest and was
          subsequently arrested for his political activities.

          Bose eventually formed the Indian National Army (INA) to fight against
          British rule in India. He died in a plane crash in 1945 under
          mysterious circumstances, but his legacy continues to inspire Indians
          to this day.
