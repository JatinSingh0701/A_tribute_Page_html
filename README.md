## About Subhas Chandra Bose

Subhas Chandra Bose was born on 23rd January 1897 in Cuttack, Orissa, and was the ninth child of a wealthy lawyer. He studied at the University of Calcutta and later went to England for higher studies. His passion for India's freedom movement led to his expulsion from the University of Calcutta due to his participation in a student protest. Bose's political activities also led to his arrest.

Despite facing adversities, Bose's determination to fight against British rule intensified. He went on to form the Indian National Army (INA), which played a significant role in the fight for independence. Unfortunately, Bose's life came to a tragic end when he died in a plane crash in 1945 under mysterious circumstances. However, his legacy continues to inspire and motivate Indians to this day.
